# Book Seller

Book Seller is a webshop simulator created only with HTML, CSS and Javascript but I didn't use frameworks or libraries.

The only objective of this small project is to summarize all I learned about frontend development.

- Web responsive: mobile first
- Search engine: search coincidence between the input form and the book list
- Filters: some optionals filters to limitate the content of the book list
- Cart: you can manipulate your cart content and simulate a buy
